The most `productive` moments I have ever had were those where I followed that feeling of going ahead without the pressure of requirements and where I didn’t spend too much time on details.

I remember the words a teacher told me when I was studying for my degree, “First get things working, then get things working right and then get things working fast”.

I think when the whole image of what you are doing is ready, only then it's time to focus on details. Because if you spend too much of that time on specific details at the very beginning, your motivation and feeling of advancement will most probably `die before the start`, so: don't stop yourself.

I think this is similar to the idea behind MVP. Just start at the starting point and don't attempt to reach the perfect image of the work on the first go.

Think about `yourself` at this time, trust me. Let yourself take one step at a time and don't feel you are doing a bad job. Don't assume you are making mistakes; it's a given that you _are_ making some, but just let them appear. Let them come to you and then, when you find them, that's probably when you should fix them and decide how to prevent them in the future.

Please, don't think that I'm proposing you make a bad planning on purpose or intentionally make mistakes from the beginning. Just put your efforts in taking baby steps aiming towards a general image of what you want, keeping things `as simple as possible` during the journey to your target.

I try to apply these ideas to whatever I do, and I recommend this to everybody who feels or has felt a loss of motivation or has got blocked on some project because of "death before birth".
